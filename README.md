# Snowflake @ Ankorstore

At Ankorstore we adopt the Snowflake tool (originally from Medium) for planning and supporting our engineers' career development. You can read more about how to use this tool in the [growth framework documentation](https://medium.com/s/engineering-growth-framework).
Our growth tool is hosted [publicly](https://snowflake.medium.com).

## Setup local environment
To setup local environment [follow that instruction](docs/setup.md)
## Installation

Install dependencies:

`yarn`

### Running the dev server

`yarn dev`

### Building

`yarn export`

This will put a static version of the site in `out/`.

## Contributions

You are free to use, change and build on this work to make it useful for your organization. We will happily consider
unencumbered code contributions to improve functionality, but as this is the actual tool we use within Medium, acceptance is likely to be intentional, and deliberate. Meaning, slow. As such, you may prefer to fork the codebase for your own needs. We will not accept any contributions that modify the text of the application (but, thank you in advance for pointing out any typos).
